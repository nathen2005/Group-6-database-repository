WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING DATABASE

Goal:To develop a database system, "SWMK", that facilitates sustainable waste management and recycling practices in Kenyan cities. 
This database will empower city officials, environmental agencies, and citizens to track progress, make data-driven decisions, and optimize waste management initiatives.
 Project Idea Definition:Kenya faces a significant challenge in managing its waste.
 Inadequate infrastructure, lack of awareness, and insufficient recycling capacity lead to environmental pollution and public health risks.
 SWMK(Our Database) addresses this by creating a robust database to track and analyze waste collection and recycling programs in Kenyan cities.
